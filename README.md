This is a mod for Mindustry that gives you iron, steel, oil processing, and alternative ways of generating materials like titanium and thorium. This mod also makes the end-game sightly harder.

There are two ways to add this mod to your game.
- Method 1: Find your mods folder and move the folder containing this file to the mods folder.
- Method 2: Open Mindustry, go to the mods, go to import from github, and enter "what42pizza/mindustry-production-mod".


If you want to contact me, please do so over discord (What42Pizza#0283).

## Known Issues:

- Sometimes when you import this mod on android, minudstry crashes. Re-openning mindustry will fix the issue and the mod will be loaded.
